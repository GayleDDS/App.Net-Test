We'd like to see if you can complete a coding challenge so we can get an idea of your work. 
Don't worry about perfecting or spending too much time on it. The main idea is to get an idea 
of your overall thought process and knowledge.
 
Create an App.net client that just lists the most recent posts from the public timeline. 
    Each post should be rendered in a table view cell, with the most recent at the top.
    Each cell should contain the user's avatar (bonus if the corners are rounded)
    Each cell should contain the poster's name in bold
    Each cell should contain the post text, and be variable height, depending on the text size
    Pull to refresh should be implemented to refresh the timeline
    The list should scroll quickly, without dropping frames on an iPhone 5
 
The timeline can be fetched here:   https://alpha-api.app.net/stream/0/posts/stream/global

Feel free to use any library you want.  The code should reflect how you write classes, methods, etc in a normal application.  
 
When you're done, just send me a zip file (or a github link).
 
Thanks,
Chaione
